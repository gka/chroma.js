# Chroma.js

[Chroma.js](https://vis4.net/chromajs/) is a ~~tiny~~ [small-ish](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=chroma-js) zero-dependency JavaScript library ([13.4kB](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=chroma-js)) for all kinds of color conversions and color scales.

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.com/gka/chroma.js.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/gka/chroma.js)

### Usage

Install from npm

```
npm install chroma-js
```

Import package into project

```javascript
import chroma from "chroma-js";
```

Initiate and manipulate colors:

```javascript
chroma('#D4F880').darken().hex();  // #a1c550
```

Working with color scales is easy, too:

```javascript
scale = chroma.scale(['white', 'red']);
scale(0.5).hex(); // #FF7F7F
```

Lab/Lch interpolation looks better than RGB

```javascript
chroma.scale(['white', 'red']).mode('lab');
```

Custom domains! Quantiles! Color Brewer!!

```javascript
chroma.scale('RdYlBu').domain(myValues, 7, 'quantiles');
```

And why not use logarithmic color scales once in your life?

```javascript
chroma.scale(['lightyellow', 'navy']).domain([1, 100000], 7, 'log');
```

Why not dive into the [interactive documentation](http://gka.github.io/chroma.js/) (there's a [static version](https://github.com/gka/chroma.js/blob/master/docs/src/index.md), too). You can download [chroma.min.js](https://raw.github.com/gka/chroma.js/master/chroma.min.js) or use the [hosted version on cdnjs.com](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/chroma-js).

You can use it in node.js, too!

    npm install chroma-js

Or you can use it in SASS using [chromatic-sass](https://github.com/bugsnag/chromatic-sass)!

### FAQ

**There have been no commits in X weeks. Is chroma.js dead?**

No! It's just that the author of this library has other things to do than devoting every week of his life to making cosmetic changes to a piece of software that is working just fine as it is, just so that people like you don't feel like it's abandoned and left alone in this world to die. Bugs will be fixed. Some new things will come at some point. Patience.

**I want to help maintaining chroma.js!**
